## APIs & Models & Datasets ##
- [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/). [Blog](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)
- [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models)
- [EleutherAI](https://eleuther.ai/) - a collection of researchers working to open source AI research. [GPT-Neo](https://eleuther.ai/projects/gpt-neo/). Primary goal is to replicate a GPT-3 sized model and open source it to the public, for free.
- [Grover](https://github.com/rowanz/grover) is a model for Neural Fake News - both generation and detection. However, it probably can also be used for other generation tasks.

## Frameworks & Librarys ##
- [Lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) is a project about explaining what ML classifiers (or models) are doing. At the moment, we support explaining individual predictions for text classifiers or classifiers that act on tables (numpy arrays of numerical or categorical data) or images.

- [TextAttack](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) is a Python framework for adversarial attacks, data augmentation, and model training in NLP. [Documentation](https://textattack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [CleverHans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) is a Python library to benchmark ML systems' vulnerability to adversarial examples.
